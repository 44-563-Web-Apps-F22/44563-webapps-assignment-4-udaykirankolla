                  <h6> ACT 2</h6>
                    
                  Zara:     How clever of you!

                  Fitz.:    Clever?  Not a bit.  It's easy as possible when the
                  Admiral-ty and Horse Guards are not there to interfere.  And so
                  with the others.  Freed from the trammels imposed upon them by
                  idle Acts of Parliament, all have given their natural tal-ents
                  full play and introduced reforms which, even in Eng-land, were
                  never dreamt of!
                
                  Zara:     But perhaps the most beneficent changes of all has been
                  ef-fected by Mr. Goldbury, who, discarding the exploded theory
                  that some strange magic lies hidden in the number Seven, has
                  applied the Limited Liability principle to individuals, and every
                  man, woman, and child is now a Company Limited with liability
                  restricted to the amount of his declared Capital! There is not a
                  christened baby in Utopia who has not already issued his little
                  Prospectus!
                
                  Fitz.:    Marvelous is the power of a Civilization which can
                  trans-mute, by a word, a Limited Income into an Income Limited.
                
                  Zara:     Reform has not stopped here—it has been applied
                  even to the costume of our people.  Discarding their own barbaric
                  dress, the natives of our land have unanimously adopted the taste-
                  ful fashions of England in all their rich entirety. Scaphio and
                  Phantis have undertaken a contract to supply the whole of Utopia
                  with clothing designed upon the most approved English
                  models—and the first Drawing-Room under the new state of
                  things is to be held here this evening.
                
                  Fitz.:    But Drawing-Rooms are always held in the afternoon.
                
                  Zara:     Ah, we've improved upon that.  We all look so much
                  better by candlelight!  And when I tell you, dearest, that my
                  Court train has just arrived, you will understand that I am long-
                  ing to go and try it on.
