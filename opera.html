        <h2>Utopia Limited - Act II</h2>
        <h3 class="scene">Scene — Throne Room in the Palace.  Night.  Fitzbattleaxe
            discovered, singing to Zara.</h3>
        <pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">

            <h6 class="name">Fitz:</h6>    
            <p class="speech Fitz"> Clever?  Not a bit.  It's easy as possible when the
                Admiral-ty and Horse Guards are not there to interfere.  And so
                with the others.  Freed from the trammels imposed upon them by
                idle Acts of Parliament, all have given their natural tal-ents
                full play and introduced reforms which, even in Eng-land, were
                never dreamt of!</p>

           <h6 class="name">Zara:</h6>
           <p class="speech Zara">But perhaps the most beneficent changes of all has been
    ef-fected by Mr. Goldbury, who, discarding the exploded theory
    that some strange magic lies hidden in the number Seven, has
    applied the Limited Liability principle to individuals, and every
    man, woman, and child is now a Company Limited with liability
    restricted to the amount of his declared Capital! There is not a
    christened baby in Utopia who has not already issued his little
    Prospectus!</p>

           <h6 class="name">Fitz:</h6>
           <p class="speech Fitz">Marvelous is the power of a Civilization which can
    trans-mute, by a word, a Limited Income into an Income Limited.</p>

           <h6 class="name">Zara:</h6>     
           <p class="speech Zara">Reform has not stopped here—it has been applied
    even to the costume of our people.  Discarding their own barbaric
    dress, the natives of our land have unanimously adopted the taste-
    ful fashions of England in all their rich entirety. Scaphio and
    Phantis have undertaken a contract to supply the whole of Utopia
    with clothing designed upon the most approved English
    models—and the first Drawing-Room under the new state of
    things is to be held here this evening.</p>

          <h6 class="name">Fitz:</h6>
          <p class="speech Fitz">But Drawing-Rooms are always held in the afternoon.</p>

          <h6 class="name">Zara:</h6> 
          <p class="speech Zara">Ah, we've improved upon that.  We all look so much
    better by candlelight!  And when I tell you, dearest, that my
    Court train has just arrived, you will understand that I am long-
    ing to go and try it on.</p>

          <h6 class="name">Fitz:</h6>
          <p class="speech Fitz">Then we must part?</p>

          <h6 class="name">Zara:</h6>
          <p class="speech Zara">Necessarily, for a time.</p>

          <h6 class="name">Fitz:</h6>
          <p class="speech Fitz">Just as I wanted to tell you, with all the passionate
    enthu-siasm of my nature, how deeply, how devotedly I love you!</p>

           <h6 class="name">Zara:</h6>
           <p class="speech Zara">Hush!  Are these the accents of a heart that really
    feels? True love does not indulge in declamation—its voice
    is sweet, and soft, and low.  The west wind whispers when he woos
    the poplars!</p>

                    <p class="duet">DUET — Zara and Fitzbattleaxe.</p>

 <h6 class="name">Zara:</h6>
 <pre><p class="song">          
                                      Words of love too loudly spoken
                                            Ring their own untimely knell;
                                       Noisy vows are rudely broken,
                                            Soft the song of Philomel.
                                       Whisper sweetly, whisper slowly,
                                            Hour by hour and day by day;
                                       Sweet and low as accents holy
                                            Are the notes of lover's lay.</p></pre>
